<h1>Soviet Sources of Radiation, detectible in US and UK</h1>

<hr />

<h2>OTH Radar</h2>

<p>The Soviets had also studied OTH systems starting as early as the 1950s. Their first experimental model appears to be the Veyer (Hand Fan) that was built in 1949. The next serious Soviet project was Duga-2, built outside Nikolayev on the Black Sea coast near Odessa. Aimed eastward, Duga-2 first ran on 7 November 1971, and was successfully used to track missile launches from the far east and Pacific Ocean to the testing ground on Novaya Zemlya.</p>

<p>This was followed by their first operational system Duga-3, known in the west as Steel Yard, which first broadcast in 1976. Built outside Gomel, near Chernobyl, it was aimed northward and covered the continental United States.[citation needed] <strong>Its loud and repetitive pulses in the middle of the shortwave radio bands led to it being known as the &ldquo;Russian Woodpecker&rdquo; by amateur radio (ham) operators. The Soviets eventually shifted the frequencies they used, without admitting they were even the source, largely due to its interference with certain long-range air-to-ground communications used by commercial airliners.</strong> A second system was set up in Siberia, also covering the continental United States, as well as Alaska.</p>

<p>In early 2014, the Russians announced a new system, called Container, that was to see over 3000 km.[10]</p></body>
